** =wolf-crypto=

This library seeks to provide a safe, zero-cost, API for =wolfcrypt= by wolfSSL. It is in its very early stages, some
feature flags are misleading, for instance =allow-non-fips= implies that when disabled only FIPS 140-3 certified
cryptography is used. This is not currently the case due to the associated =wolf-crypto-sys= not currently leveraging
the =FIPS-MODE= feature. This feature will eventually be enabled, as it was my original reason for beginning to work on
this, though the library as previously mentioned is incredibly immature.

Currently, the =hash= module is the most tested segment of this codebase, outside of this module and the =aes= module
I personally would not be comfortable using anything in a general purpose application (not any of my professional
work in security).

** Current Priority and Roadmap

- Focus on implementing and stabilizing the core FIPS 140-3 compatible algorithms.
- Improve test coverage in hashing, symmetric encryption, and AEAD modules.
- Incrementally implement and test asymmetric cryptographic functions (RSA, ECDSA, ECDH).
- Enable =FIPS-MODE= support in =wolf-crypto-sys= to align with the FIPS compliance goals.
